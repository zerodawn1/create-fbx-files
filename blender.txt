downlaod 3dcg base game + mods:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDiFXyf49kg  link in the description
	
version 1.
	create in 3dcg a model.(please make sure to set all sliders to medium, otherwise the asset will not fit to the current characters)
	(what means hight, bosom etc... ) when you are unsure about it, load the heavy save models into 3dcg. (png format)
	save the model as hard save doing it with ctrl + left click the save button.
	start the tso2pmd.exe with the girl icon.
	drag and drop, to load the png hard save in tso2pmd. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC-nj2yv64Y)
	now there are two buttons over TSO-> PMD. (you can also use the tso2pmx, but it is not working for me.)
	The left button creates a 3d viewer.
	The right button shows you a list of all 3d items for the model.
	select just one item (like clothes, you can check the selected item inside the 3d viewer)
	export the item as pmd.
	import the pmd in blender. You'll have to scale the item.
	click on the item and scale the item to x 0.08 y 0.08 z 0.08 (so it will fit the current 3d models)
	now click on the model it will be yellow selected. 
	on the right side, you'll find a button, a ball with an red shape.
	now you can view the mesh material for ths specific item.
	click on a button right beside color than image texture. 
	when everything look fine for you export the model as fbx.( make sure to use copy instead of auto and click on the button (the button looks like a folder, it should turn blue and the icon should change).
	now you're ready to export the file with textures.
	
version 2.
	open blender 
	import the plane 3d model. You'll find 3 3d models with pale, light and dark skin as fbx.
	(you need to model it for one character)
	now begins the stressful part >.< .

	when you are done, save just the clothing model.
